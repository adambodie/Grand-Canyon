                    <h2>Williams, Arizona, the town Adam woke up as a 30 year old</h2>
                    <p>At 4:42AM on May 10, 1985, Adam Matthew Bodie was born in Portland, Oregon at 8 lbs, 3 oz.  He was a handsome little devil.  His parents were really proud.  Named after his great-Grandpa Papa Arthur, Adam was destined to be special.  Exactly 30 years after he was born, Adam woke up at in Williams, Arizona, realizing he reached the goal at the exact time</p>
                    <p>After Adam woke up, took a shower and got dressed, he went for a little walk outside the Hotel, to find the sign entering the town.  Fortunately, it was just a few blocks away.  Adam was happy that the weather was sunny, though it was still cold, he knew it would warm up, so he took shorts and a sweatshirt to compensate.</p>
                    <p>After returning from a stroll in the town of Williams, Adam got his first birthday wish from his Dad, who was amazed he wrote the number 30 on the bathroom mirror.  Afterwards, Adam saw his Mom and sister, and then he received his first gift, a customized t-shirt declaring how awesome Adam is at 30.  Adam was amazed and surprised.  He didn't see it coming.  It was so cool looking.  Then Adam got his gift from his Dad, an Oregon Duck hat with hair like the one Dad had gotten.  Adam couldn't stop laughing at how he looked with spiked hair and a hat.  He couldn't stop taking pictures.  It was hilarious.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Needing to get to the Train before 9:30, Adam had his first meal as a 30 year old, an Omelet, potatoes, bacon and sausage.  Later, Adam made his way to the Wild West Show, with the World's Worst Bank Robbers arguing over playing cards and stealing purses.  It was a hoot.  A nice way to begin the entertainment I guess.  Afterwards, the Bodie family made their way to the Fred Harvey car of the Train, where they were delighted to seats on the dome, freedom to walk around, and knowing that Adam was special, at least on this particular day.</p>
